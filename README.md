# jr_tools: Tools for Learning Analytical and Programatic Implementations

## Motivation
<div class = format_text>
Those of us who work with large amounts of data use dozens of packages to get things done. Often times, we take for granted the elegant implementations even the most common package provides. After years of working with data, it has become clear that the implementations of an analysis through a programming language is often not as simple as the function the user calls or even the algorithm that defines it. Developers have to consider issues such as singularity, out of bounds estimates, numerical stability, and efficiency (not to mention all the lines of defensive coding).

## Purpose
<div class = format_text>
The purpose of this repository is to test out a variety of learning tools, statistical concepts, and visualizations. Many of these scripts are just side projects and those that turn into something real, I pull out into a separate repository. In other words, this is just a place for me to keep my notes on a bunch of algorithms and methods I find cool or interesting. Many of these projects are under development and have weird issues and boundary cases. They are intended only as illustrations of methods and individual learning and not for production.
