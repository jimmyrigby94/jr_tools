## Motivation
<div class = format_test>
Those of us who work with large amounts of data use dozens of packages to get things done. Often times, we take for granted the elegant implementations even the most common package provides. After years of working with data, it has become clear that the implementations of an analysis through a programming language is often not as simple as the function the user calls or even the algorithm that defines it. Developers have to consider issues such as singularity, out of bounds estimates, numerical stability, and efficiency (not to mention all the lines of defensive coding).

## Purpose
<div class = format_test>
The purpose of this repository is to develop and document a set of user defined functions that highlight the complexity of implementing statistical analyses and data management functions. Each script will define **one** function that serves **one** purpose and include extensive comments. Eventually, I hope to include markdown documents more fully explicating the algorithms that are being implemented and why certain elements of code were included. Many of these functions and scripts are derived from other packages, papers, and blog posts although some are original implementations written by yours truly or my colleague. I will do my best to acknowledge all of the others whose work has contributed to this material.

## TLDR

<div class = format_test>
In short, this repository is dedicated to providing a set of open source learning tools that highlight how analytical and data management functions *can* be implemented to solve specific analytic problems.
